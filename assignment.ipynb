        "\n",
        "  1. Read the abstract. What is this paper about?\n",
        "  \n",
        "  The paper Tidy Data by Hadley Wickham is about a key component of data cleaning called the data tidying. It focuses on how to structure datasets to make them easier to manipulate, model, and visualize. The key framework for tidying data involves organizing datasets so that each variable is in a column, each observation is in a row, and each type of observational unit is in a table. The paper emphasizes the advantages of using a consistent structure by demonstrates a case study from data manipulation chores.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. Read the introduction. What is the \"tidy data standard\" intended to accomplish?\n",
        "  \n",
        "   The \"tidy data standard\" is intended to make initial data cleaning easier by providing a consistent framework for organizing data. It simplifies the process of exploring and analyzing data, and it helps data analysis tools that work together without the need for translation between different formats.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, itâ€™s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  I think this sentence is implying that tidy datasets all follow a consistent and structured format, while messy datasets can be disorganized in many different ways. The diversity in how datasets getting messy require different approaches to clean and organize. The second sentence is saying that while identifying observations and variables within a specific dataset is straightfoward, summarizing a general definition that applies to all datasets is much challenging since observations and variables can vary based on the context and structure of the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. Read Section 2.2. How does Wickham define values, variables, and observations?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Values are define as individual data points that are either quantitative or qualitative. Variables are define as a set of values that measure the same attribute across different units. Observations are define as all values that measures across all attributes in the same unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. How is \"Tidy Data\" defined in section 2.3?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Tidy data is defined as each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, each type of observation unit forms a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "  6. Read the intro to Section 3 and Section 3.1. What are the 5 most common problems with messy datasets? Why are the data in Table 4 messy? What is \"melting\" a dataset?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The five most common problem are column headers are values instead of variable names, multiple variables are stored in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, and a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. The data in Table 4 are messy because the column headers contain values rather than variable names, which violates the tidy data principle that each variable should form a column. \"Melting\" a dataset refers to the process of transforming the dataset from a wide format into a long format. This involves turning the values in column headers into a new variable and gathering the corresponding values into another column.\n",
        "\n",
        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Table 11 is messy because it stores variables in both rows and columns, with days of the month as columns and temperature as rows. In contrast, Table 12 is tidy because each observation forms a row, and each variable forms a column. Table 12 is also \"molten\" because the originally wide dataset has been transformed into a long format. Furthermore in 12(b), all the entries are attributes and not variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "  8. Read Section 6. What is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem with focusing on tidy data? What does Wickham hope happens in the future with further work on the subject of data wrangling?\n",
        "\n",
        "  The \"chicken-and-egg\" problem refers to the interdependence between tidy data and tidy tools. Tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, and tools are more effective when data is tidy. Wickham hopes that further work will lead to the development of better data storage strategies and tools, as well as a deeper understanding of the statistical principles that guide the design of tidy data. He also mentions the possibility of alternative data structures."
